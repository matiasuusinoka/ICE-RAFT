# ICE-RAFT
<img src="FlowChart_Visualization.png">

Deep learning-based optical flow tool for full-field analysis of deformation in radar imagery. This work builds upon the original work of RAFT (Teed and Deng, [2020](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58536-5_24)) and the idea of differentiable warm-starting presented with E-RAFT (Gehrig, et al. [2021](https://doi.org/10.1109/3DV53792.2021.00030)) to consider a temporal multiresolution tree based on different temporal resolutions. The increased complexity enables higher accuracy in estimates and stability between different time steps needed in scientific analysis.

## Demo
ICE-RAFT can easily be used with the default models provided by [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.optical_flow.raft_large.html#torchvision.models.optical_flow.raft_large). Using a specific model can be indicated with the algorithm arguments.

The algorithm can be demoed by first running Displacement_Production.py with appropriate arguments, e.g.:
```Shell
python3 Displacement_Production.py --update_iterations 30 --image_resolution 1000 --result_file_name demoing_iceraft
```
Although the model can be run on CPUs, the user is adviced to use GPUs. This is to avoid program crashing due to on-chip memory limitations.
After producing the displacement fields, Trajectories_Strains_Deformation.py can be run (on CPUs) similarly, e.g.:
```Shell
python3 Trajectories_Strains_Deformation.py --source_file demo_data/displacements/demoing_iceraft.npy --saved_quantities all --pixel_to_metric 10 --resolution_ratio 1
```
With larger datasets the processing is adviced to be divided for parallelization with the multiprocessing library as indicated in the code.


## Arguments

### Displacement_Production.py
```--custom_model``` : Enables the use of pre-trained custom models.

```--image_path``` : Indicate the path to the images to be analyzed.

```--result_file_name``` : Giving a name to the created displacement file.

```--image_resolution``` : At what resolution will the images be analyzed?

```--displacement_resolution``` : Define temporal resolution for producing the final displacements.

```--temporal_scales``` : Define resolutions based on which the temporal multuresolution tree will be formulated.

```--update_iterations``` : The number of iterations done by each layer's update operator in the resolution tree.


### Trajectories_Strains_Deformation.py
```--source_file``` : Give the path to and the name of (with the file extension) the displacement file.

```--save_path``` : Give the path for saving the results.

```--output_name``` : Give the output filenames a prefix.

```--saved_quantities``` : Define which quantities will be saved. Options: "trajectories", "strain_tensors", "deformations", and "all".

```--spatial_scale``` : Spatial scale defines the size of the deformations objects. 2 is pixel scale, 3 the scale of two pixels etc.

```--pixel_to_metric``` : The spatial scale of one pixel i.e. how many meters does one pixel represent.

```--resolution_ratio``` : Define the resolution ratio between the original images and the displacement fields.

```--use_finite_strain``` : The deformations will either use infinitesimal or finite strain. Argument "TRUE" corresponds to using finite strains.

```--remove_displacements``` : Removing files in path data/displacements/ will save memory.
