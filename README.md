# ICE-RAFT
<img src="FlowChart_Visualization.png">

Deep learning-based optical flow tool for full-field analysis of deformation in radar imagery. This work builds upon the original work of RAFT (Teed and Deng, [2020](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58536-5_24)) and the idea of differentiable warm-starting presented with E-RAFT (Gehrig, et al. [2021](https://doi.org/10.1109/3DV53792.2021.00030)) to consider a temporal multiresolution tree based on different temporal resolutions. The increased complexity enables higher accuracy in estimates and stability between different time steps needed in scientific analysis.

```

## Requirements
The code has been tested with PyTorch 1.6 and Cuda 10.1.
```Shell
conda create --name raft
conda activate raft
conda install pytorch=1.6.0 torchvision=0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 matplotlib tensorboard scipy opencv -c pytorch
```

## Demo
ICE-RAFT can easily be used with the default models provided by [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.optical_flow.raft_large.html#torchvision.models.optical_flow.raft_large). Using a specific model can be indicated with the algorithm arguments.

You can demo a trained model on a sequence of frames
```Shell
python demo.py --model=models/raft-things.pth --path=demo-frames
```

## Arguments

### Displacement_Production.py
```--day_range``` : The starting and ending day of the period to be analyzed.

```--month_and_year``` : The month and year to be analyzed.

```--image_path``` : Indicate the path to the images to be analyzed.

```--image_resolution``` : At what resolution will the images be analyzed?

```--displacement_resolution``` : Define temporal resolution for producing the displacements.

```--temporal_scales``` : Resolutions on which the temporal resolution tree will be built.

```--update_iterations``` : The number of iterations done by each layer in the resolution tree.


### Trajectories_Strains_Deformation.py
```--day_range``` : The starting and ending day of the period to be analyzed.

```--month_and_year``` : The month and year to be analyzed.

```--spatial_scale``` : Spatial scale defines the size of the deformations objects. 2 is pixel scale, 3 the scale of two pixels etc.

```--pixel_to_metric``` : the spatial scale of one pixel i.e. how many meters does one pixel represent.

```--use_finite_strain``` : The deformations will either use infinitesimal or finite strain. Argument "TRUE" corresponds to using finite strains.

```--saved_quantities``` : Define which quantities will be saved. Options: "trajectories", "strain_tensors" and "deformations".

```--remove_displacements``` : Removing files in path data/displacements/ will save memory.
