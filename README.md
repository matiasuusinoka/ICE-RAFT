# ICE-RAFT
<img src="FlowChart_Visualization.png">

Learning-based optical flow tool for full-field analysis of deformation in radar imagery. Work builds on the original RAFT 



When using this code in research, please cite the following publication:
```bibtex
@InProceedings{UusinokaICERAFT2023,
  author = {Matias Uusinoka, Arttu Poloj√§rvi, Jari Haapala and Mikko Lensu},
  title = {ICE-RAFT: Fine-scale deformation mapping with learning-based optical flow},
  booktitle = {Journal},
  year = {2023}
}
```

## Requirements
The code has been tested with PyTorch 1.6 and Cuda 10.1.
```Shell
conda create --name raft
conda activate raft
conda install pytorch=1.6.0 torchvision=0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 matplotlib tensorboard scipy opencv -c pytorch
```

## Demo
ICE-RAFT can easily be used with the default models provided by [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.optical_flow.raft_large.html#torchvision.models.optical_flow.raft_large). Using a specific model can be indicated with the algorithm arguments.

You can demo a trained model on a sequence of frames
```Shell
python demo.py --model=models/raft-things.pth --path=demo-frames
```

## Arguments

### Displacement_Production.py
```--day_range``` : The starting and ending day of the period to be analyzed.

```--month_and_year``` : The month and year to be analyzed.

```--image_path``` : Indicate the path to the images to be analyzed.

```--image_resolution``` : At what resolution will the images be analyzed?

```--displacement_resolution``` : Define temporal resolution for producing the displacements.

```--temporal_scales``` : Resolutions on which the temporal resolution tree will be built.

```--update_iterations``` : The number of iterations done by each layer in the resolution tree.


### Trajectories_Strains_Deformation.py
```--day_range``` : The starting and ending day of the period to be analyzed.

```--month_and_year``` : The month and year to be analyzed.

```--spatial_scale``` : Spatial scale defines the size of the deformations objects. 2 is pixel scale, 3 the scale of two pixels etc.

```--pixel_to_metric``` : the spatial scale of one pixel i.e. how many meters does one pixel represent.

```--use_finite_strain``` : The deformations will either use infinitesimal or finite strain. Argument "TRUE" corresponds to using finite strains.

```--saved_quantities``` : Define which quantities will be saved. Options: "trajectories", "strain_tensors" and "deformations".

```--remove_displacements``` : Removing files in path data/displacements/ will save memory.
