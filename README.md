# ICE-RAFT
<img src="FlowChart_Visualization.png">

Deep learning-based optical flow tool for full-field analysis of deformation in radar imagery. This work builds upon the original work of RAFT (Teed and Deng, [2020](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58536-5_24)) and the idea of differentiable warm-starting presented with E-RAFT (Gehrig, et al. [2021](https://doi.org/10.1109/3DV53792.2021.00030)) to consider a temporal multiresolution tree based on different temporal resolutions. The increased complexity enables higher accuracy in estimates and stability between different time steps needed in scientific analysis.

## Requirements
The algorithm requires mainly common libraries such as Numpy, Scipy, PyTorch, Torchvision and Numba. A conda environment with the appropriate release versions can easily be installed based on the provided .yml file:
```Shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Demo
ICE-RAFT can easily be used with the default models provided by [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.optical_flow.raft_large.html#torchvision.models.optical_flow.raft_large). Using a specific model can be indicated with the algorithm arguments.

The algorithm can be demoed by first running Displacement_Production.py with appropriate arguments, e.g.:
```Shell
python3 Displacement_Production.py --update_iterations 30 --image_resolution 1000 --result_file_name demoing_iceraft
```
Although the model can be run on CPUs, the user is advised to use GPUs. This is to avoid program crashing due to on-chip memory limitations.
After producing the displacement fields, Trajectories_Strains_Deformation.py can be run (on CPUs) similarly, e.g.:
```Shell
python3 Trajectories_Strains_Deformation.py --source_file demo_data/displacements/demoing_iceraft.npy --saved_quantities all --pixel_to_metric 10 --resolution_ratio 1
```
With larger datasets the processing is advised to be divided for parallelization with the multiprocessing library as indicated in the code.

Alternatively, shell scripts similar to Initialize_Deformations.sh and Initialize_Displacements.sh can be run. The example scripts have been tested on Slurm workload manager and with NVIDIA V100 GPUs.

## Verification
The algorithm can be tested against ground truth trajectories generated with Producing_verification_groundtruths.py. In Uusinoka, et al. (2024) the performance of the algorithm was tested based on end-point-error estimates between the ground truth and optical flow estimate trajectories.

The required files for similar performance testing can be found in the 'verification_data' folder, which can be indicated with the '--image_path' argument for Displacement_Production.py. Performance testing should be done with GPUs for sufficient accuracy.


## Arguments

### Displacement_Production.py
```--custom_model``` : Enables the use of pre-trained custom models.

```--image_path``` : Indicate the path to the images to be analyzed.

```--result_file_name``` : Giving a name to the created displacement file.

```--image_resolution``` : At what resolution will the images be analyzed?

```--displacement_resolution``` : Define temporal resolution for producing the final displacements.

```--temporal_scales``` : Define resolutions based on which the temporal multuresolution tree will be formulated.

```--update_iterations``` : The number of iterations done by each layer's update operator in the resolution tree.


### Trajectories_Strains_Deformation.py
```--source_file``` : Give the path to and the name of (with the file extension) the displacement file.

```--save_path``` : Give the path for saving the results.

```--output_name``` : Give the output filenames a prefix.

```--saved_quantities``` : Define which quantities will be saved. Options: "trajectories", "strain_tensors", "deformations", and "all".

```--spatial_scale``` : Spatial scale defines the size of the deformations objects. 2 is pixel scale, 3 the scale of two pixels etc.

```--resolution_ratio``` : Define the resolution ratio between the original images and the displacement fields.

```--use_finite_strain``` : The deformations will either use infinitesimal or finite strain. Argument "TRUE" corresponds to using finite strains.

```--remove_displacements``` : Removing files in path data/displacements/ will save memory.


### verification_data.Producing_verification_groundtruths.py
```--motion_field``` : Choose which motion field to produce. The option are 'rigidbody_rotated', 'uniform_shear', 'uniform_shear_rotated', 'localized_shear', 'localized_shear_rotated'.

```--save_path``` : Give the folder for the save file.
  
```--scale``` : Choose the scale of the displacements from either 'small' or 'large.

```--num_tsteps``` : Choose the number of timesteps considered in the verification.
